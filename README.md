# FiveTA
## Capstone project for the Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree

### Description
Makes it easy for one or more people to share and control an ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) for any kind of meeting.
Want to meet up with your friend in 20 minutes? Send up a ETA. 

Something came up and you are going to be 5 minutes late!?

It’s a really minor inconvenience and you don’t want all the hassle of texting or calling your friend to tell him you are going to be 5 minutes late?

No problem!, just add 5 minutes to the ETA and your friend will know that you are running late.

Want to schedule an informal meetup with one or more friends?
Tony’s place at 7:00 pm? Make a group ETA and see if everyone is going to be on time!

### The problem
You know how people are almost never on time? Well, most of the time that can’t be changed, people are always gonna be late, there is so many factors that can affect the ultimate goal of being on time.
### Solution
Meet FiveTA, with this app you will be able to create a shared ETA that both parties will be able to see and control your version of the ETA, this means that if you are running 5 or more minutes late, you just add them to your ETA and your friend will know.
